# Examples: Python BMI

Here are examples of using the *Heat* model and its Python BMI.

* [run-model.ipynb](./run-model.ipynb) and [run-model-from-bmi.ipynb](./run-model-from-bmi.ipynb): These Jupyter Notebooks show how to interact with the *Heat* model through its API and its BMI, respectively.
* [heat.yaml](./heat.yaml): A configuration file used to pass parameters to the *Heat* BMI.
